take in the feelings of creatures over half a mile away by catching the aura emanating from others it can read their thoughts and movements reads its opponents feelings with its aura waves it finds out things it would rather not know so it gets stressed out easily not only does it perceive auras but it has also gained the power to control them it employs them in battle by reading the auras of all things it can tell how others are feeling from over half a mile away it controls waves known as auras which are powerful enough to pulverize huge rocks it uses these waves to take down its prey it has the ability to sense the auras of all things it understands human speech it can tell what people are thinking only trainers who have justice in their hearts can earn this s trust they can detect the species of a living being and its emotionsfrom over half a mile away they control auras and hunt their prey in packs it concentrates its mental energy and fires off mysterious waves called auras which can crush boulders of large size to dust its said that no foe can remain invisible to since it can detect auras even foes it could not otherwise see a most gallant looking creature it emits energy waves and controls them with precision using them to sense even faraway beings i have given the name aura to this power\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
